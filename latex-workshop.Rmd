# Hello World


### Why \LaTeX? 

- It makes beautiful documents

- Open source and active community. Lots of packages available.

- Extensible document types (articles, presentation slides, books, theses, exam papers, etc.)

::: {.alertblock latex="{Reminder}"}
Sign up for Overleaf if you haven't done so!
:::


### How does it work?

- You write your document in `plain text` with commands that describe its structure and meaning.

- The \LaTeX program then processes your text and commands to produce a beautifully formatted document.

```tex
The rain in Spain falls \emph{mainly} on the plain.
```

::: {.center latex=""}
The rain in Spain falls \emph{mainly} on the plain.

### Attitude adjustment

- Use commands to describe 'what it is' and not 'how it looks'

- Focus on your content

- Let \LaTeX\ do its job

\vspace{0.5em}

```{r latexgraph, fig.height = 3}
tibble(
  x = seq(1, 10, length = 100),
  " LaTeX" = 6 + 6 * log(x),
  " Word\n processor" =  1 + exp(x / 1.5)
) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(" LaTeX", " Word\n processor"), names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "effort") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, effort, col = type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 32), breaks = NULL, 
                     name = "Time and effort") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 10, length = 5), name = "Document type",
                     labels = c("Letters", "Essays", "Papers", "Theses", "Books")) + 
  guides(col = "none") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 10.7)) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = 0.2, end = 0.8, option = "A") -> p
  direct.label(p, "last.points")
```

### Things that it solves: Picture alignment/placement

\LaTeX\ takes care of figure placements automatically.

  group = LETTERS[1:2],
  value = c(98, 2)
) %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = value, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = NULL, labels = c(
    "You mess up\nthe whole\ndocument\n",

### Things that it solves: References and bibliography

Sometimes, however, what others tell us is important as *corroboration* of what we have already found out (or think we have found out) for ourselves.
The Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid makes this point in connection with mathematical research in the belief that, if it applies to the science 'in which, of all sciences, authoritiy is acknowledges to have least weight' \cite{reid2002thomas}, it will be even more significant in other areas of thought and practice... Russell, as we shall see in a later chapter, considered this aspect of our reliance upon testimony essential to the understanding of what it is to be a physical thing and he criticized logical positivism for its failure to appreciate the implications of this point \cite{russell2007logic}.
In the Analysis of Matter he says explicitly, `I mean here by "objective" not anything metaphysical but merely "agreeing with the testimony of others"' \cite{russell2015analysis}.

::: {.theorem name="Central Limit Theorem"}
\label{thm:clt}
Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be an independent random sample from a distribution whose mean is $\mu$ and variance is $\sigma^2$. 
Then $\bar X_n := \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ converges in distribution to a random variable whose density function is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clt}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt n} \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}
:::

The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:clt} uses *charactertistic functions*, whereby the standardised version of \eqref{eq:clt} is obtained in the limit.

- Syllabus documents
- Presentations 


# Getting started



### Getting started

\framesubtitle{A minimal \LaTeX\ document}

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, World!  % your content goes here...
\end{document}
```

- Commands start with a backslash `\`

- Every document starts with a `\documentclass` command

- The *argument* in curly braces `{` `}` tells \LaTeX\ what kind of document we are creating (in this case, an `article`)

- A percent sign `%` starts a *comment*--\LaTeX\ will ignore the rest of the line



### Getting started

<!-- \framesubtitle{Overleaf} -->

```{r overleaf, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/overleaf.png")
```

::: {.center latex=""}
https://www.overleaf.com/
:::


- Overleaf is a website for writing documents in \LaTeX.

- It 'compiles' your \LaTeX\ document online to show you the results.

- As we go through the following slides, try out the examples by typing them into the example document on Overleaf!



:::: {.varblock latex="{Exercise (Hello world)}"}

Click 
\hyperlink{https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://raw.github.com//haziqj/learn-latex/main/exercises/00-hello_world/00-hello_world.tex&splash=none}{\beamerbutton{Hello World}}
to open the "Hello world" document in **Overleaf**
(you'll need to sign in first).
Let's get started!

::::



### Typesetting text

- Type your text between `\begin{document}`{.latex} and `\end{document}`{.latex}.

- For the most part, you can just type your text normally.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=48%}
\vspace{-1em}
```latex
Words are separated by one 
or more spaces.

Paragraphs are separated by 
one or more blank lines.
```
:::

::: {.column width=48%}

Words are separated by one 
or more spaces.

\ 

Paragraphs are separated by 
one or more blank lines.
:::

:::

\vspace{0.5em}

- Blank space in the source file is collaped in the output.


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=48%}
\vspace{-1em}
```latex
The      rain    in   Spain
falls mainly on the   plain.
```
:::

::: {.column width=48%}
The      rain    in   Spain
falls mainly on the   plain.
:::

:::

### Typesetting text (Caveats)

- Quotation marks a bit tricky: Use a backtick \framebox{\texttt{`}} on the left and an apostrophe \framebox{\texttt{'}} on the right.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=48%}
\vspace{-1em}
```latex
Single quotes: `text'.

Double quotes: ``text''.
```
:::

::: {.column width=48%}
Single quotes: 'text'.

\ 

Double quotes: "text".
:::

:::

\vspace{0.5em}

- Some common characters have special meanings in \LaTeX :

    - \framebox{\texttt{\%}} is used to comment text
    - \framebox{\texttt{\#}} is used for macros definitions
    - \framebox{\texttt{\&}} is used for alignment
    - \framebox{\texttt{\$}} is used for maths

- If you just type these, you'll get an error. If you want one to appear in the output, you have to *escape* it by preceding it with a backslash \framebox{\texttt{\textbackslash}}.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=48%}
\vspace{-1em}
```latex
\$ \% \& \# 
```
:::

::: {.column width=48%}
$ % & #
:::

:::

### Handling errors

- \LaTeX\ can get confused when it is trying to compile your document. If it does, it stops with an error, which you must fix before it will produce any output.

- For example, if you misspell `\emph`{.latex} as `\meph`{.latex}, \LaTeX\ will stop with an `undefined control sequence` error, because `\meph`{.latex} is not one of the commands it knows.

::: {.block latex="{Advice on errors}"}

1. Don't panic! Errors happen. The error messages can give a clue as to what's wrong.

2. Fix them as soon as they arise--if what you just typed caused an error, you can start your debugging there.

3. If there are multiple errors, start with the first one--the cause may even be above it.

:::

### Exercise 1

Typeset the following paragraph\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States}} in \LaTeX :

> In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional $0.79 trillion to $8.97 trillion, which is approximately 68% of GDP. As of October 4, 2008, the “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008” raised the current debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion.

:::: {.varblock latex="{Exercise 1}"}

Click 
\hyperlink{https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://raw.github.com//haziqj/learn-latex/main/exercises/01-getting_started/01-getting_started.tex&splash=none}{\beamerbutton{Exercise 1}}
to open this exercise in **Overleaf**.

::::

Watch out for 

- characters with special meanings  \framebox{\texttt{\%}} \framebox{\texttt{\#}} \framebox{\texttt{\&}} \framebox{\texttt{\$}} 

- typesetting quotation marks correctly.
