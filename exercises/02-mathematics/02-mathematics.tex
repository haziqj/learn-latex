% The code below contains mathematical statements, but need to be
% fixed for it to typeset properly.

Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with
mean mu and variance sigma squared < infinity, 
and let


Sn = 1/n times the sum for i from 1 to n of Xi


denote their mean. Then as n approaches infinity, the
random variables square root n(Sn - mu) converge in
distribution to a normal N(0, sigma squared).

% Steps:
% 1. Inline math is encapsulated using $...$
% 2. Display math needs \begin{equation} ... \end{equation}
% 3. For subscripts use _ (e.g. X_i)
% 4. For superscripts use ^ (e.g. X^2)
% 5. The symbol for infinity is \infty
% 6. The symbol for summation is \sum
