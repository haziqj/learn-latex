In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional 
$0.79 trillion to $8.97 trillion, 
which is approximately 68% of GDP. 
As of October 4, 2008, the 
"Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008" 
raised the current debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion.

% Steps: 
% 1. Escape the dollar signs with backslashes (e.g. $0.79 --> \$0.79)
% 2. Escape the percent sign (68% --> 68\%)
% 3. Fix the double quotes (" --> `` or '')
